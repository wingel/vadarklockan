Python Implementation
=====================

The existing project "pyroughtime" supports both the draft 06 version
and older versions of Roughtime.

Python on Linux
---------------

The Python 3 implementation for Linux can be found in examples/python.

This version should run on most modern Linux distributions with Python 3.

MicroPython on ESP32
--------------------

The Python implementation for TTGO ESP32 can be found in examples/micropython-esp32-ttgo.

This is mostly a "toy implementation" to show that it is possible to
run the Python code on a tiny platform.  In production it would be
better to port the C implementation of "vad Ã¤r klockan" to the
Micropython environment and create a Python wrapper for it.

MicroPython on the TTGO ESP32 has very little free memory available
and alse differs quite a bit much from mainline Python.  In order to
accommodate this "pyroughtime" has had to be slimmed down and modified
considerably.

MicroPython for ESP32 has been extended with support for those
encryption primitives needed for Roughtime (ed25519, sha512) and to be
able to set the clock from Python code (settimeofday).
